Loader
A system program that performs the loading function
Many loaders support relocation & linking
Some systems have
a Linker (or Linkage Editor) to perform the linking operations
& a separate loader to handle relocation and loading
In most cases, all the program translators produce object programs
in the same format
One system loader or linker can be used
regardless of the original source programming language
